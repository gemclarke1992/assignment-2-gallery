# assignment-2-gallery

so im going to be making a gallery based on norse mythology

i am going to make sure that it can be viewed on a desktop and a mobile phone.

i am going to make sure the user can use the gallery via the buttons or using the arrows on thier screen.

i would also like to be able to make it more accessible by adding some kind of zoom feature or screen colour change feature.

i want there to be thumbnails at the bottom with a main image at the top so the user can scroll through the images easier.

i will use detailed alt tags that will clearly describe what the image is

the thing i know i will struggle with is the positioning of the gallery images.

another thing i will struggle with is the stretch features but i will not let myself run out of time if i cannot do it.s

after starting to add my js i struggled a lot with finding the right way to implenting the right way to get my thumbnails to work correctly

i struggled with working out why my thumbnail images were not working but figured out that it was because i didnt need to have the loaction of the images in the filename just the img name so i changed it

i then struggled with getting the buttons to link to my page but i realised i should have the const inside of the method

when all of my gallery was working the way i wanted it to i wanted to work on adding the use of left and right key controls to my work.
