# assignment-2-gallery

so im going to be making a gallery based on norse mythology

i am going to make sure that it can be viewed on a desktop and a mobile phone.

i am going to make sure the user can use the gallery via the buttons or using the arrows on thier screen.

i would also like to be able to make it more accessible by adding some kind of zoom feature or screen colour change feature.

i want there to be thumbnails at the bottom with a main image at the top so the user can scroll through the images easier.

i will use detailed alt tags that will clearly describe what the image is

the thing i know i will struggle with is the positioning of the gallery images.

another thing i will struggle with is the stretch features but i will not let myself run out of time if i cannot do it.s
